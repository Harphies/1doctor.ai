## Computer-aided disease diagnosis

- All our models are explainable

## The features

- computer vision for medical diagnosis

  - Systems for diabetics Retinopathy(Segmentation, Grading and Localization) based on an image of the human eye: A system which based on an image of human eye classifies Diabetic Retinopathy disease using image processing and machine learning methods
    - Morphological image processing methods are used to extract features like exudates and red lesion which characterise the disease.
    - XGBoost and other models are used to classify disease into five categories.
    - A Django/flask WebApp for demo
    - U-Net architecture for segmentation of lesions, and a ResNet model for disease grading.
  - Scanning medical images for abnormalities.

- Medical Images (X-ray, ultrasound, CT or MRI scan) for diagnosing varieties of diseases.
  - sourcing training and testing data for medical applications
